## NlsyLinks and Examples for R

The [`NlsyLinks`](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/) [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29) package contains utilities and kinship information for behavior genetics and developmental research using the [NLSY](https://www.nlsinfo.org/).  The development (and directions for installing it) are located in a [GitHub](https://github.com/nlsy-links/NlsyLinks) repository.

For beginners, the most helpful documents are:

 * [Package documentation](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/)
 * [Vignette of estimating ACE models with the NlsyLinks package](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/nlsy-ace.html)
 * [Vignette for extracting NLSY data](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/nls-investigator.html)
 * [NlsyLinks FAQ](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/faq.html)

## Examples for [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_%28software%29)
Because the links are distributed in a variety of file formats (including as non-proprietary CSVs), the are accessible by all statistical software.  The NLSY and BG concepts and basic programming are fairly consistent across languages, so the R examples should be roughly translatable into different statistical platforms.

Here's a SAS example that covers the basics.  If you have a need for a different example, or a different language, feel free to request it in the ['Other Software' section in our forums](https://r-forge.r-project.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=4316&group_id=1330).  We would like to know what examples of platforms are the most useful to the potential users of the links.

## NlsyLinksDetermination in C\#
The [`NlsyLinksDetermination` repository](https://github.com/nlsy-links/nlsy-links-determination-2017) contains the [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) code that manipulates the NLSY data to produce the relatedness values.  If you're only interested in the R package (and not how the relatedness coefficients were determined), then please see the [`NlsyLinks`](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/software-and-support.html#nlsylinks-and-examples-for-r) package described above.
