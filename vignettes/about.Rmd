Components
=============================

This website is maintained by the [Joe Rodgers](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/joe-rodgers) NLSY Sibling Research Team (see the [collaborators](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/collaborators.html) page for more details)

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (and heavily relied on the latter when forming the site's structure).  The majority of the static reports are created with  [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), while the interactive reports are created with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/); both use
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) as a foundation.

Historical Archives
=============================

To increase transparency and promote reproducibility, this website and software components are assigned a unique [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) (digital object identifier) after each substantial modification.  Each major version is archived (and [available for download indefinitely](https://zenodo.org/search?ln=en&p=MReportingPublic)) on a third-party site --where we cannot modify it.  See the [Software and Support](https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/articles/software-and-support.html) page for the DOIs of each component; all previous archives associated with the current project can be found by [searching the Zenodo site](https://zenodo.org/search?ln=en&p=NlsyLinks).

Support Forums
=============================

Our [support forums](https://r-forge.r-project.org/forum/?group_id=1330) are intended to cover all aspects of this project, not just software.

Code Collaboration
=============================

Interested collaborators are welcome to propose changes or [submit an issue](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinks/issues) on our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinks).  If you're new to GitHub, see the "Collaborating" section half-way down their [help site](https://support.github.com), or post a comment to us below.
